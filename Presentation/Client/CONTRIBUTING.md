# Introduction
Thank you for considering to contribute to Cosmos. It'll be a pleasure to have you work on this project along side other developers and designers like you that are helping me shape this app.

<br/>

# Getting Started

## Development
Make sure you have React Native and Android Studio development environment setup, if not then you can follow this [guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to do so ( make sure you setup `React Native CLI` )
- `yarn install` - installs the node packages
- `yarn start` - this will start the metro bundler
- `yarn android` - this will build the debug version of the app for android and will launch it either in the emulator or in attached devices if any.

<br/>

## Making your first contribution
Before you start your awesome work make sure you follow the below steps
1. Create your own `Fork` of the Cosmos repo
2. Create a new branch with a branch-name that starts with your name followed by what feature/issue you are going to add/resolve.
3. Now let your work begin in this new branch of yours and make sure you follow the code style for the project. You can take help from the `Development` section above
4. Once you are done, Send us a pull request on the `develop` branch on the main Cosmos app repo

<br/>

## Some key points
* Each feature/issue you work with should have a different branch which should follow the stated naming convention
* Make sure you regularly pull changes from the develop branch, as it will be kept up to date with latest changes. This can be done using the `upstream` remote in forks.
