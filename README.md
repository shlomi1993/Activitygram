# Activitygram
Welcome to Activitygram App!

This is an application that came to solve the problem that most of us encountered, finding non-virtual friends!
In this application we want to give you a fun experience of going outside the box
An opportunity to see people face to face and on the way to have a lot of fun!
So... JOIN & ENJOY!
